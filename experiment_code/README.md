Reward Effort Task
======

1. Run gripper_calibration.py (once on a pre-TUS day; measures participant's max grip strength).
2. Run main.py with 'training' as the input to 'schedule' in pop-up window (once on a pre-TUS day; longer instructions, lets participant try the task and ask questions).
3. Run main.py with one of the main schedules (on TUS day; let participant go through instructions before actual TUS to not waste time).
